        <p> I am a software developer at the Utah Climate Center where I am working on a project to create forecast charts of the rate of 
            evapotranspiration by extracting weather data. I am at this role for 6 months.

            I did my bachelors in Business Management Studies from the University of Mumbai and I am currently doing my Masters 
            in Management Information System at Utah State University. From the time when I was introduced to computers I took a 
            deep interest in them and I always wanted to learn how things work on a deeper level. I understood the basic concepts 
            and in order to know more about this domain I took up an Intro to Python course along with a MYSQL course from udemy 
            alongside my bachelors. I also read about object oriented programming and the basics of computer science principles like DSA, 
            Time complexity, space complexity of algorithms.</p>
