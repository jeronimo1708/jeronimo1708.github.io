        <p> I am a software developer at the Utah Climate Center where I am working on a project to create forecast charts of the rate of 
            evapotranspiration by extracting weather data. I am at this role for 6 months.

            I did my bachelors in Business Management Studies from the University of Mumbai and I am currently doing my Masters 
            in Management Information System at Utah State University. From the time when I was introduced to computers I took a 
            deep interest in them and I always wanted to learn how things work on a deeper level. I understood the basic concepts 
            and in order to know more about this domain I took up an Intro to Python course along with a MYSQL course from udemy 
            alongside my bachelors. I also read about object oriented programming and the basics of computer science principles like DSA, 
            Time complexity, space complexity of algorithms.</p>

        <h4>Utah Climate Center (Software Development Engineer)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a program using Beautiful Soup to automate data ingestion of hourly weather data from the National
                    Centers for Environmental Prediction website. This program dropped the time spent for data download by 55%.</li>
                <li>Created a system to push metadata of the downloaded data to a PostgreSQL database to avoid data
                    inconsistencies. Reduced duplicate data downloads by 100%.</li>
                <li>Automated the ETL workflow - data download, extraction of NetCDF from Grib2, and adding ET data to NetCDF.</li>
                <li>Created line charts to forecast the rate of evapotranspiration (ET) using (Tableau) with an accuracy of 74%.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>ASPIRE Research Lab (Graduate Research Assistant)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Explored and analyzed Electric vehicle datasets using Pandas, Preprocessed data and created visualizations
                    (Matplotlib, Tableau) for EV datasets to collect insights for creating Qualtrics surveys.</li>
                <li>Researched Electric vehicle journals to understand consumer perception towards Electric Vehicle's. Created
                    written documents summarizing the work done in 437 research papers to find the current gaps in research.</li>
                <li>Collected nationwide data using Qualtrics surveys, analyzed the new dataset applying sentiment analysis
                    (NLP) to understand the role marketing messages play in the adoption of Electric vehicles.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>EclinicalWorks (Software Development Engineer)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Provided a POC for a fraud detection model to prevent claim-based fraud. Developed a ML model (Logistic
                    Regression) to detect anomalies using historical data and trends of a practice.</li>
                <li>Worked with the web development team in an AGILE (CI/CD) environment to build a HIPPA compliant EMR
                    application (appointment scheduling) for multiple web browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and
                    Safari) using Node.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and a PostgreSQL database.</li>
